All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreaming on such a winter's day

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A
California dreaming on such a winter's day

I stopped into a church
I passed along the way
Well I got down on my knees and
I pretended to pray yeah
You know the preacher liked the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreaming on such a winter's day

I'd be safe, I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe, I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm

All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
If I didn't go
I could leave today
California dreaming on such a winter's day
Oh such a winter's day
On such a winter's day
